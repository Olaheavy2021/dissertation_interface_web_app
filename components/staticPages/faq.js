A dissertation that is largely based upon interview data and observation records can be of greater length than a dissertation that is based upon software development and statistical data, for example, as it will usually make intensive use of interview quotations or observation records. A useful guideline is that the dissertation should enable you to formulate and justify a clear argument concerning your research question. Quantity does not equal quality.",
